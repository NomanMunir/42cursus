# Parsing
[*] Check the file extension is .cub
[*] Map has NO, SO, WE, EA texture with proper extension .xpm
[*] Ceiling and floor have RGB color within 0 and 255
[*] Only 0 for Empty Areas, 1 for Walls, N, S, E or W for user's starting direction in map
[*] There are multiple textures for the same wall (north wall texture).
[*] replace tabs to 4 spaces.
[*] No more that one player
[*] Non-rectangle map must be operable
[*] map must be closed/surrounded by walls
[*] Except map content, each type of element can be separated by one or more empty line
[*] Map content has to be the last element.
[*] Except for the map, each type of information from an element can be separated
    by one or more space
[*] The map must be parsed as it looks in the file. Spaces are a valid part of the
    as long as it respects the rules of the map.

# Ray Casting



# Movement
[*] left and right arrow keys to look left and right 
[*] The W, A, S, and D keys to move
[*] ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
[*] red cross on the windowâ€™s frame must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
[*] The use of images of the minilibX is strongly recommended.

# Start
Based on the viewing angle, subtract 30 degrees (half of the FOV).
Starting from column 0:
[*] Cast a ray.
[*] Trace the ray until it hits a wall.
[*] Record the distance to the wall (the distance is equal to the length of the ray).
[*] Add the angle increment so that the ray moves to the right (we know from Figure 10 that the value of the angle increment is 60/320 degrees).
[*] Repeat step 2 and 3 for each subsequent column until all 320 rays are cast.

[*] Crazy ray
[*] Intersection
[*] Short Walls
[*] getting in the wall
[*] TILE and TILE_3D
[*] change put_pixel
[*] too much leak. fix it
[ ] track for memory leak
[*] tab to spaces are still not good.
