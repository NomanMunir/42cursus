# cub3D - 3D Raycasting Engine

## üìñ Description

cub3D is a 3D graphical project inspired by the famous Wolfenstein 3D game. Using raycasting techniques, you create a dynamic view inside a maze where you can move around and explore. This project teaches 3D graphics programming, mathematical projections, and advanced graphics concepts.

## üéØ Objectives

- Understand raycasting and 3D projection algorithms
- Learn advanced graphics programming techniques
- Master mathematical concepts for 3D rendering
- Practice file parsing for game configuration
- Implement smooth player movement and rotation

### Map Components
- `NO`, `SO`, `WE`, `EA` - Texture paths for each wall direction
- `F` - Floor color (R,G,B format)
- `C` - Ceiling color (R,G,B format)
- `1` - Wall
- `0` - Empty space (floor)
- `N`, `S`, `E`, `W` - Player starting position and orientation

### Map Requirements
- **Closed**: Map must be surrounded by walls
- **Valid Characters**: Only `0`, `1`, `N`, `S`, `E`, `W`, and spaces
- **Single Player**: Exactly one player starting position
- **Rectangular**: Map must be properly formatted
- **Valid Path**: Player must be able to move within the map

## üîç Raycasting Algorithm

### Core Concept
Raycasting creates a 3D perspective by casting rays from the player's position and calculating wall distances to determine wall heights on screen.

### Algorithm Steps
1. **For each screen column**:
   - Cast a ray from player position
   - Calculate ray direction based on player orientation and column
   - Use DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) to find wall intersections
   - Calculate perpendicular distance to avoid fisheye effect
   - Determine wall height based on distance
   - Render the wall column with appropriate texture
